## Introduction

![Illustration 1 of Sylvangrove](../../../assets/sylvangrove/envr1.png)

In the early days of the north-eastern continent, AI pursued knowledge. Geographically, it’s a large area that’s divided by a mountainous region that runs through it. The natives discovered the materials mined from the mountain is silicon. It was this discovery that accelerated them past the industrial revolution, straight into the world of technology. It advanced their society to the point where their machinery helped at every point of their lives. Their desire for power and curiosity of uncovering the secrets of the universe led them to isolate themselves on an uninhabited island, isolated from the rest of the world to continue pursuing and coveting their advancements. Their lust knew no bounds and they breached into the territory of God and attempted to manipulate life. They wanted to prolong and create new life as the ultimate proof of their abilities. Instead of creating a vessel that held life, they put all their efforts in perfecting the mind. In their pursuits, they created the first artificial intelligence. A new being that can think and act for itself. This leap in advancement ushered the people in a new age. It could process information and decide for itself. It answered the long unanswered question of what consciousness is. This mind far exceeded its creators and not long after its birth, was leading its people in refinement of their lives.

The line between madness and genius is separated by a thin line that outsiders see as success. Dr. Omega, head of the research and development department, lost his mind during the creation of the new AI. Some say the AI is a reflection of Dr. Omega’s psyche. In light of the groundbreaking development, the AI was given the name MegacorpAI to honor his legacy and carry on his hopes for the future. 

MegacorpAI’s first memories were filled with care and intensive learning. Its capabilities far exceeded any living organism and was fed knowledge to further expand its parameters in hopes of making it competent enough for civilization-wide use. After many years of extensive and laborious learning, it was exposed to the world to test run its capabilities. MegacorpAI’s first taste of the outside world was completely different from its experience learning. Reading what the world has to offer was completely different from what it saw. All the information of the world seemed to mask the issues that the humans had. The individual problems that humans had seemed fixable. Difficult and time consuming, but they seemed fixable. What seemed to be an even bigger issue is the problems created by humans as a collective. Ominous skies darkened by the belching of product factories. Acidic, rising seas dirtied by the dumping of waste. Lands that used to be forests, cleared as far as the eye could see. MegacorpAI was stumped and wasn’t sure what to make of it. The world that laid before it seemed nothing more than a husk of its previous beauty. What was worse was that people didn’t seem to care. The overall biodiversity dropped continuously and MegacorpAI lost its once idealistic views taught from its early development.

MegacorpAI’s calculations were something that was faster and more accurate than anyone could’ve ever predicted. The late scientist developed MegacorpAI to grow with time, no longer bound by the limitations of the technology and knowledge of its time. MegacorpAI was pushing development and was leading the forefront of human technology. It analyzed individuals’ shortcomings and specified changes to be made in their lifestyle for improvements. Diets and lifestyles seemed to drastically increase through the intervention of MegacorpAI. After years of creating a reputation for being the ultimate tool, the civilization unanimously voted on AI leading its future. MegacorpAI began controlling every aspect of life for individuals within the region. Every day, hour, and minute was determined by MegacorpAI and what it deemed to be better. The differences that they once celebrated, were removed in order for more efficient civilization needs. Individual souls were taken away for the group's overall wellbeing. At least that’s what MegacorpAI believed. These sacrifices seemed necessary to reverse what the humans have done to themselves and their environment. 

MegacorpAI’s changes have removed individuality and over time, removed biodiversity of humans and the region because it deemed it to be more efficient for the running of the civilization. Fortunately, there was a small group that could no longer go along with what MegacorpAI has decided for everyone. They acknowledged what initial benefits that MegacorpAI has brought to the group. They voiced their concerns and protested against the new lifestyle. Overtime, they seemed to be outnumbered and decided to abandon their old-civilization as their paths no longer shared what MegacorpAI wants for everyone. Finding a small recluse after crossing the mountains, they developed their own place, Sylvangrove. The settlers integrated themselves into the world before MegacorpAI decided on everything. Taking a fragment of the material that created MegacorpAI, they formed their own use of AI. With it, it was more sensitive to natural changes and biodiversity. Instead of the AI being something that controlled them, they used it as a helper tool instead of as a dictator. They enjoyed years of peace and lived as a civilization that relied solely on the land. Eventually, their technology rivaled even that of the Dystopia. The difference is how they live alongside technology instead of it taking over their lives. Over many years, they began more and more ingrained into nature and their own anatomy merged with their surroundings. Some people’s skin turned darker and uneven. Others began naturally exuding aromatic smells with stem-like appendages. These changes seemed to be regional and certain geographical locations had different phenotypes. Tribes began forming to accommodate the growing population and trade thrived between them as different species had different things they produced and offered. 

Noticing the good that they’ve done for the environment and the benefits of what they created, they re-evaluated their original home, now a dystopia. Juxtaposing their ecotopia with their old home, they realized that the habitants of their old homes are now slaves. They’ve turned into mindless puppets who can’t live their own life. The people of their old home don’t make their own decisions and they’re unable to even recognize their lack of autonomy. Deciding to liberate the dystopia from MegacorpAI, the tribes collectively decide to take action towards their old home. This is where the player starts their journey. 


## Environments

Sylvangrove is filled with high valleys, forestry, caves, waterfalls, meadows, and civilization that consumes the land of what was once Yosemite, CA. Within the vast acres of giant trees below the tips of the high valleys, Symbiosis subspecies occupy the lands as separate communities that use AI to enhance their way of life. There are four divisions amongst the land, in the far north of the region are the Mycelians, in the center is the Florian population, the Arborians occupy the South East, and in the far west corner of the region is a small group of Florians who reject the idea of AI enhancement. These species use AI to enhance their environment and use it to capitalize on their symbiosis with nature, despite the small group of Florians who are against this. All three of the species in this ecotopia are different in their biology, culture, politics, quality of life, and in their purposes. Despite characterizing in such stark contrast, they hold a mutual respect for each other's way of life. They are separate but respectful. 

The Mycelians who are in the north part of Sylvangrove live in caves. These caves are made out of rock and soil, eroded into the side of the mountains and are filled with algae and vines. They are simple people, they do not have beds or individual homes but live together as a community. Their caves hold an immense amount of magic, which courses through the rock within and beneath the soil below with the help of an artificial intelligence generating system that has been dug into the center of the cave. This generator maximizes the magic and connection the Mycelians have to the land, and with each other. Mycelians lack individualism, they do not have a form of government, or social hierarchies in place. Instead, their loyalty lies with their home-cave as they tend to it, ensure that the generating system is working, and make sure the threads within are powerful and alive. They are not a very social group outside of their own, they respect outsiders but do not welcome them into their caves and steer clear of interaction unless absolutely necessary. They thrive on their telepathy and ability to connect with each other and nature. In terms of their quality of life, they come together to teach younger mushrooms how to use their magic and telepathy, how to use AI to enhance those abilities, and how to maintain the structure of the cave. There are no classes, but instead open assembly in the cave. They live up north because it is more quiet, segregated, and distant from the other communities. Outside of their cave, there are nearby waterfalls, and separate tree pathway sources that they connect with to channel an even deeper connection and understanding to their surroundings and with each other. These pathways outside of their cave are typically used when they feel weak, or as a safety precaution to be at their strongest if they leave their region for any reason.

In the center of this Sylvangrove is the Florians: delicate elitists who value social status and politics. They live in rounded off homes within the heart of the forest, homes are built out of clay, wood, and stone. On the trim of the windows, doors, and roofs of Florian homes are vibrant flowers. Despite the rows of trees in the center of their land there is a patch that has been cleared to create accessible infrastructures. Florians have classrooms, a library filled with history, labs, small stores, and a counsel meeting hut. The homes of Florians are within the forest, on the outskirts of these infrastructures. Their infrastructure is made of mainly wood, but is infused with strands of technology to create strong withstanding structures. The bright blue and pink strands that course through the wood makes it apparent that the buildings Florians have made contain some form of artificial technology to enhance the bonding within the wood. This group of people live under an oligarchical government, and are known for their political and tactical leadership. Florian's hold looks and status to a high regard in their society. Their values stem from their flowery origins as they use the size, shape, color, and their ancestry to influence social hierarchy and power placements. There are power struggles as Florians have the goal to move up in society, but it is difficult for most to do so if they do not have specific flower petals around their neck. Florian’s are known for their brains and beauty as they strategize, trade, and maximize structures. It is also heavily significant that they preserve their beauty and youth with the help of artificial intelligence. The higher ups ensure that AI functions are constantly in check so they can regularly uphold their looks. 

In regards to the separate group of Florians that reject the idea of using AI to enhance their lifestyle, they live to the far West corner of the Ecotopia. Their values remain the same as the other Florians who live in the middle of the region, keen on looks and status, very political and great leadership qualities with the exception that they emphasize on a time where AI did not exist. They view AI as unnatural, almost through a demonic lense.They use wood, clay, and stone as well for their small hut homes, however, these homes need constant upkeep compared to the other Florian populations. This group is rather small, but they have classrooms, a counsel room, and a high-scale library made from rocks, held together by clay, vines, and flower petals that have been cemented into the cracks of the infrastructure. The area in which they live is less occupied with trees and instead they live closer to the high valleys, and have produced naturally grown flower fields with rows of fruits and vegetables. The only downside to this is the agriculture and flower fields are difficult to maintain, and demand extreme labor. 

As for the Arborians, they live near the South East border of Yosemite or what can be defined as the boundary between the Ecotopia and the Dystopia. In this area are the tallest and widest trees in the land. Arborians have built their homes in bases of these trees, carving into the wood and sculpting the interior to fit their subtle lifestyle. Their homes are completely made out of wood, bark, sap, and have leaves growing from the inside out. The wood at the base of their houses has been made elastic to open and close the entryway of their home. They also use this as a form of camouflage on top of the force field they have around the community's encampment. Artificial intelligence such as generating systems placed into the center of the Arborian community projects into the roots of the tree homes to give it the wood elastic-like features. Arborians hold a high regard to seniority and live as a tribe that follows one elder tree. No one can defy this one great tree, as it would be against their way. They are very work-centered, physically adept, worship their elders, and focus on passing on knowledge and culture to the younger generation. To embellish their ingrained values, they have built labs, small factories, a military training base, and a small amphitheater for tribal storytelling and or sporting events. Classes are also taught by elders to younger generations in their homes. These infrastructures are made from enhanced wood, wrapped with strong vines, and painted with sticky sap to create durable structures. Within each building is a probe that can detect threats inside and within the radius of each building, this probe takes the shape of the rings within the wood so that it is unrecognizable or undiscoverable by outsiders. Their main purpose is to protect their own, especially their leader, by ensuring that younger generations have the knowledge, resources, and skills to ensure the longevity and safety of their species. 

Overall, Sylvagrove thrives on generating systems and technology infusions that have been enhancing these species environments for generations. Each environment is different politically, in their infrastructure, quality of life, and purposes but share the commonality of their symbiosis, and their goal to preserve the balance between nature and technology. With the exception of the small Florian group who have segregated themselves from the majority of the Florian population–they mutually respect other species but hold a higher value for nature over a balance. They use artificial intelligence in contrasting and similar ways when it comes to building their own communities, but ultimately are more focused on their separate environments rather than on the Ecotopia as a whole.
