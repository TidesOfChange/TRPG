## Introduction and Lore

Grønn Verden didn’t always look the way it does today. When the farmers and the seed keepers fled their home after the wildfire, Grønn Verden was like a paradise and they were happy to call it home. The seed vault provided the farmers with the necessary seeds to create a biodiversity hub. The land was lush with trees, shrubbery, flowers, and most importantly endless produce for the farmers to harvest. However, eventually MegaCorp began to implement rules. Seeds were no longer allowed to be taken from the seed vault to the outside to be planted. The seed keepers had to keep the seed library under strict lock down and the farmers no longer had access. This did not stop the farmers from cultivating their already planted crops on the outside, however, and they used their plants to grow more. Then the next ruling from MegaCorp came. The seed keepers were threatened with the loss of their jobs and were forced to dig up all the plants, destroying their roots and seeds, leaving all but the potatoes and wild berries unsalvageable. The farmers were no longer able to grow all of the crops they were used to. Instead they had to survive off of the potatoes and berries that MegaCorp allowed the seed keepers to leave. Eventually, the evil corporation began to see the farmers as the root of the problem. The farmers had initially been brought in to start the seed vault’s green house to ensure that if all else failed, the world would still have readily available produce at their finger tips. However, the green house was thriving and the farmers were no longer needed. So they were the first to go. The only problem was that MegaCorp needed something to look after the plants and ensure they were being cared for. This is when they developed robot farmers. The seed keepers tried to protest when they saw their friends, family, and neighbors be cut out and replaced by robots. However, it was only time before they too were replaced by robot seed keepers.

After they were cut out and all their seeds were taken from them, the farmers made it their mission to write down all of their knowledge with the help of the seed keepers. They feared that without having their seeds they would lose their healing abilities so they made books documenting their life's work. They spent years documenting the healing properties of certain plants, the danger of others, and the benefits the plants provide to the earth. Eventually once everything was written down, they began telling stories so their abilities could live on in their children and grandchildren. They spoke of healing rituals performed to bring life back into living things. They spoke of the dangers of greed and taught their children and their grandchildren the importance of biodiversity. Today, in addition to their story telling, they practice healing ceremonies on their potato and berry crops to ensure they still have enough food to survive off of while also ensuring it stays bountiful.

Outsiders rarely come to Grønn Verden anymore. Most people had been forced here through the wildfires, and now people don’t have much reason to flock to the oasis anymore due to the lack of bountiful food. Without access to their crops from the seed vault the villagers are barely able to support themselves. When outsiders do come nowadays they tend to not stay long after seeing the legends they heard about Grønn Verden were no longer true. Some outsiders stay, but they are the ones that chose to help fight with the farmers and seed keepers against the corporation that fired them. At first this help was unwanted, but now many of the older villagers that were there when the seed vault had been closed, retell the stories of the old days and continue teaching these newcomers the ways of the farmers and seed keepers. Those that are not from here are able to learn, but always stay separate from the rest of the village since many villagers, especially the poor, do not want to fight for food with a larger population.

Life within the Seed Vault is very different from what it used to be. The robots that replaced the farmers and seed keepers continue to work within the walls of the vault. No one is allowed within the vault anymore. MegaCorp used to have office workers there to watch over the robots, but even they too were forced to leave the vault and work remotely in another location. The corporation created the robot seed keepers in order to keep the seeds away from the villagers. These robots have been programmed to attack any and all things or beings that don’t belong. On the other hand the farming robots' only task is to continue cultivating produce that is available for sale to the villagers. With this produce being the only source of food outside of the potatoes and berries allowed to be grown outside the vault, MegaCorp sells this produce at high prices. The farmer robots are programmed differently than the seed keeper robots. The farmer robots don’t recognize if anything or anyone around them are supposed to be there. They still have the ability to attack others though. This is seen whenever a crop has been touched by anything but the farmer robot that is in charge of that crop. The farmer robots are very protective of the plants, so it's best to keep away from them. Each farmer robot has a specific job within the greenhouse and loading dock in order to keep the produce healthy and to ship out safely to the village. To ship out the produce, MegaCorp employs select anonymous villagers as drivers.

Anything high tech within Grønn Verden is hidden within the seed vault. The MegaCorp made sure nothing high tech was ever able to reach the villages. Within the seed vault everything is as high tech as they could make it. This includes the computers in the abandoned office, the equipment in the lab, the farming tools for the greenhouse, and the storage system for the seed library. Much of this technology could have helped the farmers and seed keepers in the village continue their research and log their understanding of their crafts, so MegaCorp kept this access very limited and completely monitored at all times. It is now so rare to be able to see any technology within the villages, that all the villagers have reverted to keeping physical notes and word of mouth to continue keeping tradition alive. Any scraps of technology that the villagers find is repurposed into anything needed within the villages at the time of finding it.

## Environment
In the villages, buildings are cobbled together from whatever material people can scavenge. Buildings are constructed with concrete slabs, rusted thin sheets of metal, and pieces of wood, defunct structures from cities and towns, now serving as homes. The walls are rough and nonsmoothed, and they are made of a combination of stone and metal; the walls have bolts and cement patched up. These homes are constructed with only the barest necessities in the pursuit of comfort.

In the villages, people get by on older, cobbled-together technology: scrounging old solar panels for electricity, building simple radios for communication, and using hand tools for farming. Still, all is pieced together from scraps, frequently breaking down, and there is a great deal of trial and error involved. All technology is treasured here, reutilized, and repaired until it is no longer in a working state.

Getting around is not easy in this barren land. It is composed of dry, cracked earth and rock, and no traditional vehicles can travel on it. The roads are infrequent, and little fuel remains for motorized transport. So, it is the old-fashioned ways that people rely upon to make their way across the landscape: bicycles, sturdy carts pulled by animals, at times, using little else than one's feet. These modes go slower but are resilient and meant for traveling on rough terrain over long distances. To get across small pockets of habitable lands, villagers might use sleds or wagons that can drag across the barren soil; they might just walk across cracked earth if the distance is less or take old pathways. Water is scarce, but where this is found to accumulate, small rafts of wood or dinghies are utilized, pushed along by poles or manually.

Due to the loss of biodiversity, Grønn Verden is no longer the green world it once was. The once plentiful land is now barren and dry, leaving the farmers very little opportunities to grow what little seeds they still have access to. The people survive off of potatoes and berries they grow themselves and if they are lucky, any produce they can afford to buy from the seed vault. However, most people can afford very little after being laid off from the evil corporation MegaCorp and being replaced by robots. This is because once MegaCorp had all of the seeds stored away, they realized they could profit from the lowering availability of seeds in the outside world. While the evil corporation initially hired the seed keepers to protect the seed vault and ensure that all the seeds were properly stored away, they eventually realized they could be replaced by automated robots. However, MegaCorp still needed the farmers' skills to resurrect and grow portions of the seeds they had stored away. But once the plants were successfully growing and they had their first successful harvest, the corporation fired the farmers and replaced them with robots too. Although the seed vault had originally been the solution to the rising sea level globally and the wildfire that drove the seed keepers and farmers to Grønn Verden, now it is the obstacle their children are struggling against. While there was an abundance of plants growing in the seed vault, the people of Grønn Verden saw only a fraction of it. 

In hopes of being able to have access to all of their seeds again, the original farmers who migrated to Grønn Verden wrote down their knowledge in books in order to keep their practices alive. Today this is what the farmers study to honor their mothers and fathers. While they don’t have access to most of the plants their parents wrote about, they practice with the seeds they still have access to. As such, now the farmers make their living growing what potatoes and berries that they sell to the outside world. The seed keepers on the other hand had difficulty finding work once they were cut out of the seed vault. Instead they used their strength to their advantage and formed a police force to keep the people of Grønn Verden safe. Today, that police force is still running but because of the lack of crime in Grønn Verden they do a little bit of everything to help out and make the lives of their community easier. But most importantly, they protect the people of Grønn Verden from MegaCorp. 

Once MegaCorp cut the farmers out, some of the ones that stayed passed along some of the stories to their children and to those who would listen to them. They passed these stories and knowledge through word of mouth but also by writing down the most important information. They took great pride in taking care of the seeds as they thought of it as giving back to the earth. The area has a significance to them as they feel like they, in a way, “owe” it to the earth as they have been able to survive on it even after the damage that has been inflicted so far. They feel their new mission is to help fight back against the evil corporation and replant the seeds. Not only do they feel like they have an obligation to the earth but due to MegaCorp, their resources they do have are very limited. Due to this shortage of reliable resources relocating takes months of hard work and planning. The farmers that do decide to leave have to take months of saved and self-stable foods, have little to no family left and believe that it is up to them to go and try to find better conditions for the seeds locked up in the vault. They have no access to the seeds but believe that there is hope that one day they will have access to those seeds.

Depending on how one views it, the farmers have a robust military. Many of them have some sort of healing powers since they have worked with taking care of the seeds and therefore the plants that grow from them. Farmers have very strategic thinking and are able to make a strong plan. Being connected to the earth in some way guides them on what choices they need to make or help guide people to. They aren’t super strong or built but due to them taking care of the crops they are strong. There is a lot of valuable material and the trade location is great for the MegaCorp as it allows them to control what they give out to the other people in other sections of earth. MegaCorp controls the trade and has not consulted the farmers about the trade  because they know the farmers would not want to profit from the seeds the same way that they want to. The farmers want to help the planet with very little to no monetary profit while MegaCorp just wants money without concern about the planet. Since there are people in other locations on the map that don’t know how to take care of the plants like the farmers did, MegaCorp discovered that they could make a lot of profit from providing the trade with other locations on the map. Most of the trade that happens in this area is often done among the rich MegaCorp leaving the poor with the very few crops that they are able to survive on. The profit of the trade MegaCorp receives goes directly into their pocket instead of helping the people in the village. 

From the outside, the seed vault is made of dark concrete and is a tall, ominous building. The vault is shiny and smooth on all surfaces, with no visible windows, and is rectangular in shape. It is built to withstand many types of weather and shows no signs of wear or cracking.

To enter the vault, the only access is a truck-sized garage door on the front of the building. This garage door was used as access for trucks to unload seeds for the vault and is now used to transport food out of the vault. Within the Seed Vault everything is run remotely by MegaCorp. This is done through different types of robots. We have the new seed keeper robots that replaced the common folk. These seed keeper robots work within the seed library. The other robots in the seed vault are the farmers. These robots are found in the greenhouse area of the vault. 

The seed vault contains all the seeds necessary in order to restore biodiversity. The seeds within the vault were selected based on special properties that they have on restoring biodiversity. For example, some of the species are legumes which are known for their ability to fix nitrogen into the soil (which is necessary for other species of plants to grow). Another important type of plant is trees which have the ability to raise water from aquifers and thereby lower the temperature of the soil allowing other plants to have a cooler growing temperature.

The seed vault is also designed to grow some of the plants within the vault. These plants are grown to feed the general population and is how the corporation monetizes on the villagers. MegaCorp grows only certain types of plants and sells them to the villagers, ensuring that the villagers are malnourished and dependent on the seed vault’s output for survival.
