## Introduction

Karkorte comes to exist in the future, where the attempts at minimizing humanity’s carbon footprint over the course of hundreds of years could not keep up with ever-increasing issues of climate change. Gradually, the landfills had become overfilled due to extreme human overpopulation. Trash seeped into cities and into the oceans, contaminating many forms of life and environments. While frantically attempting to fix this quickly changing world, the sea levels were rising, submerging multiple large land masses. Many humans were unable to adapt to the extreme environmental changes taking place, where cities collapsed from water pressure and food became scarce. 

At the time, a large corporation had a monopoly over all the US’s operations. Employees of the mega corporation who worked at nuclear sites left these plants unattended in search of higher ground. This resulted in the catastrophic failures of all four power plants in Pennsylvania, causing nuclear fallout to affect multiple, nearby states and an end to mega corporations in the US. Humans that persisted to survive in partially submerged waters met unfortunate fates due to the severity of the polluted waters and nuclear fallout. Those that did survive became mutated citizens. The ocean life which arrived with the rising waters became mutated as well due to the nearby radiation. Many of the nearby mutated ocean life became hostile towards mutated humans, leading to their classification as monsters. 

As ocean levels continued to rise, air bubbles began to take form, encompassing small cities. The origins of these air bubbles stem from the many unknown testing experiments from the mega corporation, which suggest that the corporation had been testing technology in preparation for rising sea levels. However, the impact of the nuclear explosions caused irreversible damage to the city and the membrane of the bubble. This bubble was thus classified as uninhabitable and left abandoned, except for a small population of mutated citizens which chose to reside within the remnants of the city. Buildings that were partially destroyed became homes and places of refuge for the mutated citizens, where they hid in fear of this new yet utterly destroyed world. This gave rise to the land of Karkorte, a village composed of a small population of mutants living in the debris of destroyed cities.

Over time, mutated citizens gradually developed specialized mutations that differentiated them into different subspecies: Kraken and Moby.
Species name: Kraken
The Kraken subspecies mainly manifests as physical mutations in the body, often growing extra limbs, or enhanced muscles suited for underwater tasks. These mutations give them superior swimming and physical abilities, making them more competent for tasks requiring strength and endurance in harsh environments.
Species name: Moby
The Moby subspecies evolved with enhanced sensory abilities such as sonar perception and higher cognitive functions. Their senses allow them to detect danger and find resources, often acting as guides and strategists in the community. These advanced sensory abilities make them better at navigating polluted waters, locating safe areas, and ensuring the safety of their communities.

In this community, tradition exists to please the old ones long forgotten, aka monsters that were created from the nuclear wasteland. The citizens wonder why they sacrifice food to the ancient Gods. Some believe these to be eldritch Gods that will bring peace and hope to this world. There are enough clues to indicate that they had to sacrifice citizens and use them as bait to keep some of these monsters away. The amount of times they relocated in the last time gives off hints that citizens were killed as bait. Mutants do not rot like normal living beings. The monsters are not something that is considered normal, but a way of life that resulted in a civil war. It was a large debate on should we continue this disgusting religion of sacrifice. In the end, the side that won said we would sacrifice some food instead of citizens, but the food has to be citizens so that the monsters take the bait. Eventually, a hero of the citizens raised his sword and killed the monster. This led to some misinformation about the GODs blessing the hero. Now some citizens believe God will help them reach new heights to become the ruler of the world. 

There is also Radium (a legendary metal) obtained from the monster's blood. These metals are legendary as it is thought to carve the world. The supposit eldritch Gods are monsters slayed by the hero that as a mutate of legendary proportion is said to be still alive. Radum is seen as a holy stone. There is also Belismun which also comes from the monster blood. This metal is considered useless. 

Because Karkorte consists of salvaged abandoned buildings, shielded by a damaged bubble’s membrane (damaged by radiation), it remains very vulnerable to attacks from nearby monsters since the membrane of the bubble is not sturdy enough to hold them at bay. This had led to multiple casualties in the city as the civilians were at mercy to these monsters. Not only is the city of Karkorte unsafe from mutated sea life (monsters), but the citizens are also constantly on the verge of starving. The radioactive water conditions and the threat of the sea monsters has led to a shortage in food. There aren’t any opportunities available to farm and get any stable food supply. Instead, mutated citizens must venture outside the protection of the bubble’s membrane in order to explore for scraps of sea foliage or, if they are lucky enough, some fish. 

Most mutated citizens are content with each other and with the government laws. They work together to build their shelters and defend against attacks from monsters. Also, since the species Kraken and Moby have different strength and skills – Kraken is more physically strong and Moby are more knowledgeable and sensory to the surroundings, these two species would work together for living. For example, Kraken could provide physical resources they find in dangerous areas or carry heavy items like building materials or food, using their strength. Meanwhile, Moby could share knowledge about making the best use of resources or offer advice on efficient food storage. In addition, Moby’s sensory awareness and knowledge allows them to predict and detect potential threats early, warning Kraken so they can prepare defenses. Meanwhile, although Kraken and Moby are now very different, they were once just ordinary humans. This shared history helps them find common ground and makes cooperation feel natural despite their new forms.

The most notable landmark in the region would be the three mile island. Three mile island is a nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania and was abandoned due to the rising sea levels. Due to it being abandoned, a nuclear meltdown occurs and causes the area around to become radiated causing the mutations in the game. Around this area, the radiation is really strong and causes the civilians of Karkorte to become nauseous. This area would be able to be explored where it can contain higher quality resources, but poses a risk as the area around here is more dangerous and contains more aggressive monsters.
