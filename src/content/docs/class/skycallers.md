## Description
Both feared and hallowed amongst the residents of Aeolian Archipelago, the name “skycaller” invokes omens of both awe and terror. Skycallers are exceptionally rare weather shamans capable of taming the storms that ravage the Archipelago, and are both feared and respected amongst all. Relentlessly hunted by FLOoN for their valuable and dangerous powers, skycallers are forced to live in secret, with many opting to join cloudrunner cells for protection. Skycallers are key assets to cloudrunner cells, who would surely perish navigating the raging tempests of the Archipelago otherwise. Due to their innate connection to the environment, skycallers are greatly affected both physically and mentally by pollution, which is why many skycallers choose to fight against the megapolluting FLOoN. It is unknown how skycallers came to be or where their powers are sourced from, but many skycallers revere Veltharion the Tidebinder, the legendary first skycaller, as the source of their powers.
